# CEM-ERL 
#### Cross Entropy Methods - Evolutionnary Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of [CEM-RL (A.Pourchot 2018)](https://github.com/apourchot/CEM-RL) in Salina and implementation of CEM-ERL.

CEM-ERL is an evolution of CEM-RL where the td3 agent instead of only computing one step and applying his gradient to half of the population is a fully autonomous agent of the population.
